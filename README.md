<h1 id="installation">Installation</h1>

- If you are updating your Town Of Impostors version, please hop to this section [here](#updating-the-mod).

- Before installing, verify your Among Us version by launching the game and checking the version displayed in the top left of the main menu.

- As of the Among Us v2021.3.31.3s update, **you must sign in to your account and set your player name now** to avoid issues later such as setting your name or typing in the chat in the modded game.

- Download the Mod for your specific game version from the table below or check all releases [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases). **ENSURE THAT YOUR AMONG US VERSION MATCHES EXACTLY - EVERY DIGIT, LETTER, DOT & ALL.**

- Make a copy of your clean, unmodded game’s root directory `Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us` and rename the copied directory to whatever you want e.g. `Steam/steamapps/common/Among Us Town Of Impostors`. This copied directory is what will be modded. You can get to your root directory by right-clicking Among Us in Steam -> Properties -> Local Files -> Browse. **RECOMMENDED STEP TO KEEP SEPARATE COPIES IN CASE YOUR MODDED GAME BREAKS & TO AVOID AN AUTO-UPDATE BREAKING THE MOD.**

- Extract the contents `TownOfImpostors.zip` into the copied folder you created.

- Ensure the copied directory that is being modded now contains at least the following:
```
.
├── Among Us_Data
├── BepInEx <---
├── mono <---
├── Among Us.exe
├── baselib.dll
├── doorstop_config.ini <---
├── GameAssembly.dll
├── steam_appid.txt <---
├── UnityCrashHandler32.exe
├── UnityPlayer.dll
└── winhttp.dll <---
```
<details>
 <summary>Still unsure? Click this for an image of what it should look like if you have hidden file name extensions</summary>
 <img src="Pics/TownOfImpostersDirectoryNew.png">
 </details>
 
- **Make sure to launch the game via the Among Us.exe from this directory**. Please note that the first time launching the game with this mod may take a while - give it one minute before worrying that nothing is appearing.

**Verifying installation success**
- Launching the game via Among Us.exe
- In the top-left corner of the main menu, below the Among Us version, you should see _Town Of Impostors vX.X.X Mod by AJMix_ to indicate the mod is running and has been successfully installed.

If you don't see this message or have any other issues, please take a look at the <a href="#troubleshooting">troubleshooting section</a>.


**Version Mismatch Checker:**
- Starting from v1.8.1 onwards, there is now a version mismatch checker that'll make sure that all users in the lobby are using the same game version. If a red message appears on the top right stating **"Warning: Player Version Mismatch"**, then there's a potential that someone in the lobby is not using the correct version.
- Sometimes this warning message can appear when something strange occurs, even if all users in the lobby are using the same version. If you're 100% sure all users in the lobby are using the same mod version, simply have players rejoin the lobby.

_Before raising an issue, please double check that you have accurately followed the installation instructions and you are not using any mod manager or other mods._

_Starting from v1.5.0 onwards, there is a new reset custom settings button in the lobby. Please use it if your settings are bugged. Settings can bug when you update from version to version, it's best practice to reset settings._

_Starting from v1.6.0 onwards, this mod should now be compatible with Mod Manager by MatuxGG. Please note that using the Mod Manager to install the mod still does not guarantee that the mod will work as intended._

### Saving and Loading
Starting from v1.8.1, you can now save and load your settings. This is to help lower the issue of settings completely messing up between versions. You should find a new `TownOfImpostorsSettings.txt` in the Among Us folder where the mod is installed. This can also be passed onto others so they can play with your settings!

From v1.8.6 onwards, there are now 5 **Save & Load** slots. You can use these to save multiple settings. You will be able to find them as `TownOfImpostorsSettings_1.txt`, `TownOfImpostorsSettings_2.txt` etc. inside of the `TownOfImpostors_Data` folder. Please launch the game or create the folder yourself if you don't see it. These settings can be passed onto others. If you were using the previous `TownOfImpostorsSettings.txt` before, please move this into the folder and rename it to `TownOfImpostorsSettings_1.txt`.

### Uninstalling the Mod
- If you copied the Among Us folder as instructed by the Installation Steps, simply delete the copied folder.
- If you did not, and you unzipped the mod into your main Among Us folder, then you have to delete the following folders & files:
  - **BepInEx** folder, **mono** folder, **doorstop_config.ini**, **winhttp.dll**

### Updating the Mod
It is recommended to keep separate folders for each version of Town Of Impostors instead of overwriting, even if the Among Us version between them is the same and it appears that the bundled files are the same in each release. But if you're intent on updating an existing version of the mod with a new version that is compatible to that version of Among Us: 

- Please ensure you **extract and overwrite all** that has been asked. Do not pick and mix, or extract only the `TownOfImpostors.dll` for updating. Each release was crafted for the BepInEx it is bundled with, so there will be errors if the wrong version of BepInEx is used.

- We've begun labelling the mod with `TownOfImpostors-X.X.X.dll` to help differentiate between the versions under file explorers, so you may not receive a confirmation to overwrite the mod itself. Whilst this should not cause any issues as BepInEx checks and uses the latest version of a mod, if there are any problems, please proceed to `\Among Us Modded\BepInEx\plugins\` and delete the older versions of the mod.

- Inside your `\Among Us Modded\BepInEx\`, please delete the `\cache\` folder.

- You may have to sign in again to your account. If it does not work inside the modded game, please launch the unmodded version and sign in through there first before returning to the modded game. This is why we recommend copying and working with a copied directory of Among Us that is not auto-updated by Steam but also a backup for any issues involving modding.

- In the lobby, please click Reset Settings on the bottom left when playing a new version of Town Of Impostors. See [Known Issues](#known-issues) for why. If you're running v1.8.1 or higher, you may use the Save Settings before the update, then Load Settings after the update to restore your Town Of Impostors configuration.

- Now hope all is good! If there are errors, you can always resort to a fresh installation of the mod with another copy of the unmodded Among Us folder!

You can download the mod on Curseforge <a href="https://www.curseforge.com/among-us/all-mods/town-of-impostors">here</a>.

<h1 id="customhats">Custom Hats</h1>

**Only for versions v1.7.1 onwards**

## How do I add my own Custom Hat?

### New System:
* Download the **new** template, along with the default empty manifest.json to being making Custom Hats for Town Of Impostors (you may still use the old template if you want to) **Massive thanks to JonyKasual for working hard to create an advanced template**
  * Download an empty `manifest.json` [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v2.0.0/manifest.json)
  * Download .psd template 150x185 [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v2.0.0/ToI_CustomHat_Template_150x185_v2.psd)
  * Download .psd template 225x280 [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v2.0.0/ToIHat_AdvancedTemplate_225x280.psd)
  * Download .psd template 300x370 [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v2.0.0/ToIHat_AdvancedTemplate_300x370.psd)
  * Download .png template for Idle (150x185) [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v2.0.0/ToI_CustomHat_Template_150x185_Idle_v2.png)
  * Download .png template for Climbing (150x185) [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v2.0.0/ToI_CustomHat_Template_150x185_Climbing_v2.png) 
* Draw your hat on the template and save in PNG format, with a unique name (make sure to also hide the crewmate and shadow). Preserve the resolution.

* With the new system, you will be able to create hats for all layers (Front, Back, Climbing) and have to all compiled into one, as long as it is all specified in the manifest.json. You will also be able to create animated hats, and specify other parameters such as hat bounce, adaptive color and whether to hide crewmate.
* To get animated hats, set the animated parameter in the manifest.json to `true` and add to the list of Front, Back or Climb images
* Please leave `PivotPoint` and `PixelsPerUnit` as default values if you don't know how they work
* You may use any name for the folder and files as long as everything is specified correctly in the manifest.json, but for the folder it is recommended to use the naming convention `<hat name>_<creator name>` for clarity
* Submit your entire hat bundle as a `.zip` file in the discord
* Please see the `ExampleHat_AJMix` bundled in the build for an example of how the new system works
* If the new system is too complicated, you may always continue using the **Old System**

### Old System:
* Download the template used to make the Custom Hat for Town Of Impostors **(Big Thanks to Con No 1 for the template)**:
  * Download .psd template [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v1.8.2.1/ConTemplate.psd)
  * Download .png template [here](https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/releases/download/v1.8.2.1/ConTemplate.png)
* Draw your hat on the template and save in PNG format, with a unique name (make sure to also hide the crewmate and shadow). Preserve the resolution.
  
* **IMPORTANT:** Please follow this naming convention `<HatName>_<Credits>_<Modifiers>` for your PNG. See below for list of modifiers. If you want spaces in your names, use `-` to represent spaces. For example, `Bouncy-Hat` will be processed into `Bouncy Hat` inside the game.

**Example Names:** `Wing_Spaced-AJMix_back.png`, `Bouncy-Hat_AJMix_bounce.png`, `BouncyWings_AJMix_back_bounce.png`, `Simple-Hat_AJMix.png`, `Advanced-Hat_AJMix_bounce_anycolor_-1.1f_+2.3f.png`

* Place the custom hat png into the `TownOfImpostors_CustomHats` which can be found inside of the Among Us directory you have the mod installed (launch the game once and start a lobby with the mod or create the folder yourself if it does not exist)

* Your custom hat should now appear in the hats tab **locally**. If you want everyone to see the same thing **make sure everyone has the same hats in the custom hats folder.**

---

### Modifiers
*All hat modifiers are **case sensitive**!*


`_back`
> If you want your hat to be behind the crewmate (i.e. wings). 

`_bounce`
> If you want it to bounce while the crewmate walks.

`_anycolor`
> **From v1.8.2 onwards**, you'll be able to also add this as an additional modifier to have your hat match the colour of your crewmate. You'll need to use **Red** _(Hex: FF0000)_ for the base colour, and **Blue** _(Hex: 0000FF)_ for the shading. See example of how this is done here: 

![ExampleByDark](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/78827892/114481635-dacf1380-9bfc-11eb-8032-e839df7240ec.PNG)  

### Advanced Modifiers
*All hat modifiers are **case sensitive**!*


`_0.0f_0.0f`  
> **From v1.8.6 onwards**, you can now add **X** and **Y** offsets to the name to position the hat more accurately in the menu i.e. `Simple-Hat_AJMix_-0.5f_+0.3f`. You need to specify both an **X** and a **Y** offset. Placing a **+** or **-** in front will indicate whether it should be positive or negative. _Placing no symbols will default it to positive._ The offsets must follow the exact example as shown, with a decimal number followed by an _"**f**"_.

## Want to add your hat as part of the mod so everyone can use it?
* Simply follow the same steps above to create a Custom Hat, please join the discord server and post your hat in the custom hat channel there so it can be ready to add in the next release. Please also follow the naming convention so I know the hat name, credits and whether you'd like it to be added to the **back** of the crewmate and whether you'd like it to **bounce**.
* The Hat Name and Credits will be grabbed from the file name, as long as you have followed the naming convention. When someone wears your hat, credits will appear underneath the mod credits! (i.e. `AJ Scarf by AJMix`, `Dark Scarf by Darkbrussel`)
* I'll try my best to get your Custom Hat into the next release of Town Of Impostors!

## Where can I download more custom hats from the community?
Please join the discord to find more custom hats from the community, as well as download links!

<h1 id="customcolors">Custom Colors</h1>

**From v1.8.6 onwards**, you will be able to add your own custom colors.

Add your custom colors to the file `TownOfImpostors_CustomColors.txt` which can be found in the `TownOfImpostors_Data` folder. Please launch the game and create a lobby once if you don't see the folder or file, or manually create them yourselves. 

Follow this example to add a color:
> `255,255,255,255 220,220,220,255 Pure_White PWH`

Each part of the entry stands for this:
> `MainColor` `ShadingColor` `LongName` `ShortName`
> 
> For the colors the format is: R,G,B,A (values between 0-255)
> 
> Separate each part with a space, use `_` to represent spaces in the long name.

**In multiplayer, everyone must have the same `TownOfImpostors_CustomColors.txt` to see and use the same custom colors!**

---

<h1 id="streamermode">Streamer Mode</h1>

**From v1.7.1 onwards**, there is a new streamer mode that can be toggled on.

This makes it easier for streamers as they won't have to manually hide the code anymore on stream, it will be hidden automatically.

### How do I get the room code?
When you create a room, the room code will be copied to your clipboard. Simply paste it somewhere and pass it onto others.

If you accidentally copied something else before pasting the room code somewhere, you can get your copy/clipboard history by using `Windows Key + V`. Or you can just make another room.

## Modifiers

### Lovers
This activates the Lovers modifier. Two players are selected as random to be lovers (if applicable). Impostors can also be selected as Lovers. Jesters & Arsonists cannot be selected as Lovers. There can not be more than 1 Impostor Lover.

Lovers can still get their own special roles, and can still win as normal with their respective teams.

However, the Lovers can achieve a special "Lovers Win". The goal of the Lovers is to stay alive together and win together at the end. Lovers will achieve the special Lovers Win if they are both among the **last 3 players** standing. The only exception to this is if the custom option **Game Continues With Arsonist** is toggled on and the Arsonist is among the last 3. The game will continue as long as the Arsonist is alive.

Lovers are given the ability to chat with each other via a special Lovers Chat in-between meetings.

# How does role assignment work?
The role selection works as follows:
For each role, it will attempt to add that to the selection pool **X** number of times, where **X** is the maximum count. The chance of the role being added to the selection pool each time is based on the percentage chance set in the custom options for the specified role.

Once the selection pool is filled, the roles in there will then be randomly assigned to Crewmates (who are not already Impostors and don't already have a special role). As long as there are roles in the pool to assign and Crewmates to assign them to, they will be assigned out. If there are no more roles to be assigned out, the remaining players will just stay as normal Crewmates.

Example:
_**Sheriffs - # Max Count: 3 | % Chance: 50**_

This means that the role selection will try to put 3 sheriffs into the pool, at 50% chance each time. So the pool can end up with 0, 1, 2 or even the maximum of 3 Sheriffs.

# FAQ
 
### Can you play Proximity Chat (Crewlink) with it?
Yes, Crewlink supports Among Us Modifications

### Can this mod work with other mods?
I cannot guarantee that this mod will work with other mods. There will likely be conflicts. You will have to test yourself. 

### Do my friends need to install the mod to play it together?
Yes. Every player in the lobby must have the mod installed. Please don't use and play mods in unorganised public lobbies.

### Can you get banned for playing on public servers?
At the current state of the game there is no perma ban system, though this may change depending on the stance of the Among Us developers. The mod is designed in a way that it does not send prohibited server requests. In a public lobby with randoms, with only you having the mod installed, you would either be kicked for strange behaviour or have a desync between you and other users that do not have the same mods, or both. In short, as long as this mod is played among friends in your own private lobby, you're safe.

If you are really worried, I recommend checking out <a href="https://github.com/Impostor/Impostor">Impostor</a> to start your own custom, private server. (You may have to disable their AntiCheat implementation for it to work with mods like this).
**Still, a disclaimer that you use this mod at your own risk and I am not responsible for any account suspensions that may occur from the use of this mod.**

### How can I join servers of a custom region?
This functionality has been removed from 1.6.0 onwards. Please look into using <a href="https://github.com/MoltenMods/Unify">Unify</a>

### Can this mod work with controllers?
This mod was not made to be compatible with controllers in mind; it was intended to be played with keyboard and mouse.

<h1 id="troubleshooting">Troubleshooting</h1>

### The mod isn't installed or game doesn't launch
- Please make sure you're using the latest version of the mod and the correct version of Among Us for it
- Please make sure you're using Windows, this mod is not compatible on Android, Mac or any other OS/devices
- Please make sure you're using this with the **Steam** version of Among Us; this is not compatible with the itch.io version unfortunately
- Please make sure you're not loading other mods along with this one
- The first time launching the mod may take a while, so please allow a minute before worrying that nothing is appearing. If nothing has happened for a while, please open your Task Manager (CTRL+ALT+DEL) and close the Among Us process, then attempt launching again.
- Make sure you have followed all the <a href="#installation">installation steps</a>, especially launching the game via the Among Us.exe file in the modified game directory.
- Try uninstalling the mod (see uninstalling the mod in the Installation Steps) and following the installation steps again
- If you're using a Mod Manager to install the mod, it is not guaranteed to work
- You might be missing some cpp libs (software libraries used by the mod); please install Visual C++ redistributable packages [x86](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x86.exe) & [x64](https://aka.ms/vs/16/release/vc_redist.x64.exe)

### The mod still doesn't work or found a bug?
You can <a href="https://github.com/AJMix/TownOfImpostors/issues/new">raise an issue within GitHub</a> documenting your issue. You will need to be logged into GitHub to do this.
For any bugs, take a quick check if your bug has already been listed under the below [Known Issues](#known-issues) or if it has already been reported. Please give as much detail as possible regarding the issue, including steps to reproduce it if possible. If it exists, please also attach your **LogOutput.log**, generated in the Among Us\BepInEx\ folder.

## Known Issues
- When updating from version to version, settings can bug and cause unintended effects. This is due to how new custom settings are being added in each update. If you are getting strange bugs occurring with the settings, try manually settings everything again (to overwrite the saved settings on your computer) by manually toggling options on and off, setting timers and settings counts. You can also do a hard reset by running vanilla among us and creating a lobby, then reopening among us with this mod. In v1.5.0 onwards, there is a new reset settings button the host can make use of to do a hard reset on all custom settings to reset everything to default values

- Disconnections in the middle of the game can cause bugs to occur, and the only way to fix them would be starting a new game or restarting the game. This mod was made with the assumption that no one would disconnect as disconnections are a whole other edgecase to fix. Future updates will hopefully fix this, but for now, just start another game or restart the client if a disconnection causes your game to bug
